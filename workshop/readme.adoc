= Lab: Deploying and Managing OpenShift Container Storage with Rook-Ceph Operator

== Lab Overview

This hands-on workshop is for both system administrators and application developers interested in learning how to deploy and manage OpenShift Container Storage (OCS). In this lab you will be using OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 (OCP) and Rook.io v0.9 to deploy Ceph as a persistent storage solution for OCP workloads.

=== In this lab you will learn how to

* Configure and deploy contanerized Ceph using Rook’s cluster CustomResourceDefinitions (CRD)
* Validate deployment of Ceph Luminous containerized using OpenShift CLI
* Deploy the Rook toolbox to run common ceph and rados commands
* Create a Persistent Volume (PV) on the Ceph cluster using a Rook OCP storageclass for deployment of Rails application using a PostgreSQL database.
* Upgrade Ceph version from Luminous to Mimic using the Rook operator
* Add more storage to the Ceph cluster

== Deploy Ceph using Rook.io

=== Scale OCP cluster and add 3 new nodes

In this section, you will validate the OCP environment has 1 master, 1 infra, and 3 compute nodes before increasing the cluster size by modifying the /etc/ansible/hosts file and then running ansible-playbook scaleup.yml. After playbook completes again validate the OCP environment and confirm there are 3 new OCP compute nodes.

----
oc get nodes
NAME                                          STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
infra.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com    Ready     infra     1h        v1.11.0+d4cacc0
master.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com   Ready     master    1h        v1.11.0+d4cacc0
node01.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com   Ready     compute   1h        v1.11.0+d4cacc0
node02.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com   Ready     compute   1h        v1.11.0+d4cacc0
node03.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com   Ready     compute   1h        v1.11.0+d4cacc0
----

Now going to add 3 more OCP compute nodes to cluster

----
grep '#scaleup_' /etc/ansible/hosts
sudo sed -i 's/#scaleup_//g' /etc/ansible/hosts
vi  /etc/ansible/hosts
----

Test hosts can be reached using ansible.

----
ansible new_nodes -m ping
node05.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node06.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node04.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
----

Run the scaleup.yml playbook. This will take a approximately five minutes to complete.

----
ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-node/scaleup.yml
----

Validate that there are 3 new nodes (node04, node05, node06) with the compute label.

----
oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true
----

=== Download Rook deployment files and install Ceph

In this section necessary files will be downloaded using the `curl -O` command and OCP resources created using the `oc create` command and the Rook.io yaml files.

Labeling the new OCP nodes with role=storage-node will make sure that the OCP resources (OSD, MON, MGR pods) are scheduled on these nodes.

----
oc label node node04.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com role=storage-node
oc label node node05.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com role=storage-node
oc label node node06.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com role=storage-node
oc get nodes --show-labels | grep storage-node
----

Next you will download Rook.io scc.yaml, operator.yaml and cluster.yaml to create OCP resources. After downloading each on view the file using the `cat` command before creating the resources using `oc create`.

----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/travisn/rook/openshift-commons-demo/workshop/scc.yaml
oc create -f scc.yaml
----

Validate that rook-ceph has been added to securitycontextconstraints.security.openshift.io.

----
oc get scc
oc export scc
----

Install the Rook operator next.

----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/travisn/rook/openshift-commons-demo/workshop/operator.yaml
oc create -f operator.yaml
oc project rook-ceph-system
watch oc get pods -o wide
----

Wait for all rook-ceph-agent, rook-discover and rook-ceph-operator pods to be in a Running state. The log for the rook-ceph-operator pod should show that the operator is looking for a cluster. Look for `the server could not find the requested resource (get clusters.ceph.rook.io)` at the end of the log file. Replace `xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx` below with your rook-ceph-operator pod name.

----
oc logs rook-ceph-operator-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx
----

Next step is to download and install the cluster CRD to create Ceph MON, MGR and OSD pods.

----
oc new-project rook-ceph
oc adm pod-network make-projects-global rook-ceph
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/travisn/rook/openshift-commons-demo/workshop/cluster.yaml
----

Take a look at the cluster.yaml file. It specifies the version of Ceph, the label used for the rook resources (role=storage-node) added at the start of this section, and the nodes and storage devices used for OSDs.

----
cat cluster.yaml
...omitted...
  placement:
    all:

    - name: "node04.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com"
      devices:
      - name: "xvdd"
    - name: "node05.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com"
      devices:
      - name: "xvdd"
    - name: "node06.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com"
      devices:
      - name: "xvdd"
----

Now create the MONs, MGR and OSD pods.

----
oc create -f cluster.yaml
----

Disregard this message “Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "cluster.yaml": namespaces "rook-ceph" already exists”

----
watch oc get pods
NAME                                        READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

rook-ceph-osd-1-7747889669-fcvsj            1/1	      Running     0          1m
rook-ceph-osd-2-7cc7bdf44d-ncqbr            1/1	      Running     0          1m
----

Once all pods are in a Running state it is time to verify that Ceph is operating correctly. Download toolbox.yaml to run Ceph commands.

----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/travisn/rook/openshift-commons-demo/workshop/toolbox.yaml
oc create -f toolbox.yaml
----

Login to toolbox pod to run Ceph commands.

----
kubectl -n rook-ceph exec -it $(kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod -l "app=rook-ceph-tools" -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') bash
ceph status
ceph osd status
ceph osd tree
ceph df
rados df
exit
----

Disregard the ‘health: HEALTH_WARN mons a,b,c are low on available space’ message when viewing results of `ceph status` command.

=== Create Rook storageclass for creating CephRBD block volumes

In this section you will download storageclass.yaml and then create the OCP storageclass `rook-ceph-block` that will be used by applications to dynamically claim persistent storage (PVCs). The Ceph pool `replicapool` is created when the storageclass is created.

----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/travisn/rook/openshift-commons-demo/workshop/storageclass.yaml
cat  storageclass.yaml
----

Notice the provisioner: ceph.rook.io/block and that replicated: size=2.

----
oc create -f storageclass.yaml
----

Login to toolbox pod to run Ceph commands. Compare results for `ceph df` and `rados df` executed in prior section before the storageclass was created.

----
kubectl -n rook-ceph exec -it $(kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod -l "app=rook-ceph-tools" -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') bash
ceph df
rados df
rados -p replicapool ls
exit
----

== Create new OCP deployment using CephRBD block volume

In this section the `rook-ceph-block` storageclass will be used by an application + database deployment to create persistent storage. The persistent storage will be a CephRBD volume (object) in the pool=replicapool.

Because the Rails + PostgreSQL deployment uses the `default` storageclass we need to modify the current default storageclass (glusterfs-storage) and edit then make `rook-ceph-block` the default storageclass.

----
oc get storageclass
oc edit sc glusterfs-storage
----

Remove this portion shown below from storageclass `glusterfs-storage`. Make sure to note EXACTLY where this annotations is located in the storageclass (copying this portion and before and after syntax to clipboard would be good idea). The editing tool is `vi` when using `oc edit`.

----
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
----

Add the removed portion to `rook-ceph-block` in same place so it will be the default storageclass. Make sure to save your changes before exiting `:wq!`. Validate that `rook-ceph-block` is now the default storageclass before starting the OCP application deployment.

----
oc edit sc rook-ceph-block
oc get storageclass
----

After editing storageclass `rook-ceph-block` the result should be similar to below and `rook-ceph-block` should be the `default` storageclass.

----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2019-03-08T20:54:46Z
  name: rook-ceph-block
...omitted...  
----

----
$ oc get sc
NAME                        PROVISIONER               AGE
glusterfs-storage           kubernetes.io/glusterfs   5h
rook-ceph-block (default)   ceph.rook.io/block        35m
----  

Now you are ready to start the Rails + PostgreSQL deployment.

----
oc new-project my-database-app
oc new-app rails-pgsql-persistent -p VOLUME_CAPACITY=5Gi
oc status
oc get pvc
watch oc get pods
----

Wait until the pods are all in a Running state. This could take 5 minutes.

----
NAME                                 READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
postgresql-1-zktk2                   1/1       Running     0           3m
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-build       0/1       Completed   0           4m
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-sztht       1/1       Running     0           1m
----

Once the deployment is complete you can now test the application and the persistent storage CephRBD volume.

----
oc get route
NAME                     HOST/PORT                                                                              PATH      SERVICES                 PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
rails-pgsql-persistent   rails-pgsql-persistent-my-database-app.apps.xxxxxxxxxxx.aws.testdrive.openshift.com
----

Resuts of this command will be similar to above. Replace `xxxxxxxxxxx` with your unique value.

Put ‘rails-pgsql-persistent-my-database-app.apps.`xxxxxxxxxxx`.aws.testdrive.openshift.com/articles’ in a browser tab to create articles.

The username/password to create articles and comments is by default `openshift`/`secret`. You should be able to successfully create articles and comments. When they are saved they are actually saved in the PostgreSQL database which stores its table spaces on a CephRBD volume provided by OCS.

Lets now take another look at the replicapool created by the OCP storageclass. Log into the toolbox pod again.

----
kubectl -n rook-ceph exec -it $(kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod -l "app=rook-ceph-tools" -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') bash
----

Run the same Ceph commands as before the application deployment and compare to results in prior section. Notice the number of objects in replicapool now.

----
ceph df
rados df
rados -p replicapool ls | grep pvc
exit
----

Validate the OCP PVC is the same name as the PVC object in the replicapool.

----
oc get pvc
----

== Using Rook to Upgrade Ceph

In this section you will upgrade Ceph from from Luminous to Mimic using the Rook operator. The first thing we need to do is update the cluster CRD with the mimic image name and version.

----
oc project rook-ceph
oc edit cephcluster rook-ceph
----

Modify the Ceph version in the cluster CRD. Using `oc edit` is the same as using editing tool `vi`.

----
spec:
  cephVersion:
    image: ceph/ceph:v12.2.11-20190201
----

To this version new below. Make sure to save `:wq!` the changes before exiting.

----
spec:
  cephVersion:
    image: ceph/ceph:v13.2.4-20190109
----

Once the change to the ceph version is saved as shown above, the MONs, MGR, and OSD pods will be restarted. This could take 5 minutes.

----
watch oc get pods

NAME                                         READY         STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
rook-ceph-mgr-a-7448c76545-4kqjf             1/1	   Running     0          3m
rook-ceph-mon-a-54d7966c5-5xrz7              1/1	   Running     0          4m
rook-ceph-mon-b-7f6c449744-d8dbj             1/1	   Running     0          4m
rook-ceph-mon-c-5d666798c5-8q96l             1/1	   Running     0          4m
rook-ceph-osd-0-59cc694647-cpptn             1/1	   Running     0          5s
rook-ceph-osd-1-78b56fc845-bmw4h             1/1	   Running     0          3s
rook-ceph-osd-2-f78c88c48-w7mst              1/1	   Running     0          2s
----

Now let's check the version of Ceph to see if it is upgraded. First we need to login to the toolbox pod.

----
kubectl -n rook-ceph exec -it $(kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod -l "app=rook-ceph-tools" -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') bash
----

Running the `ceph version` command shows it has been upgraded to Mimic. Run other Ceph commands to satisfy yourself (e.g., ceph status) the system is healthy after the upgrade. You might even want to go back to the URL used for the Rails+PostgreSQL application and save a few more articles to make sure applications using Ceph storage are still working.

----
ceph version
ceph version 13.2.4 (b10be4d44915a4d78a8e06aa31919e74927b142e) mimic (stable)
exit
----

== Adding storage to the Ceph Cluster

In this section you will add more storage to the cluster by increasing the number of OSDs per OCP nodes using spare storage devices on the nodes.

Before we make any changes to the cluster CRD let's see what storage is available on our OCP nodes. It is important that the available storage be a raw block device with no formatting or labeling. There should be a storage device availalbe, all of the same size, on the same nodes that were originally used.

----
oc get nodes -l role=storage-node
NAME                                          STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
node04.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com   Ready     compute   1h        v1.11.0+d4cacc0
node05.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com   Ready     compute   1h        v1.11.0+d4cacc0
node06.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com   Ready     compute   1h        v1.11.0+d4cacc0
----

To check the storage SSH to one of the OCP nodes that have the role=storage-node.

----
ssh node04.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com
----

Check the storage devices on node. You can see that 50GB storage device `xvdd` is used already by Ceph. Storage device `xvde`, also 50GB, is not used yet.

----
[cloud-user@node04 ~]$ lsblk
NAME                                                                    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE
...omitted...

                                                                        253:1    0  50G  0 lvm

----

Also /dev/xvde looks to be a raw block device with no labels, which is required.

----
[cloud-user@node04 ~]$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/xvde

Disk /dev/xvde: 53.7 GB, 53687091200 bytes, 104857600 sectors

I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

[cloud-user@node04 ~]$ exit
----

After validating the available storage for increasing the number of OSDs we are ready to modify the cluster CRD and add an additional storage device, `xvde`. 

To make this easier we have created a new cluster CRD yaml file that has the new storage device already added correctly instead of editing the cluster CRD using `oc edit`.

----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/travisn/rook/openshift-commons-demo/workshop/cluster_with_xvde.yaml
----

Take a look at the new cluster CRD yaml file.

----
cat cluster_with_xvde.yaml
...omitted...
  storage:
    useAllNodes: false
    useAllDevices: false
    nodes:
    - name: "node04.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com"
      devices:
      - name: "xvdd"
      - name: "xvde"
    - name: "node05.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com"
      devices:
      - name: "xvdd"
      - name: "xvde"
    - name: "node06.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com"
      devices:
      - name: "xvdd"
      - name: "xvde"
----

Now add the additional storage device `xvde` to each node above.

----	  
oc apply -f cluster_with_xvde.yaml
----

Once this new defiition is applied the 3 additonal rook-ceph-osd pods will start. Wait until they are in a Running state before proceeding.

----
watch oc get pods
NAME                                       READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

----

Let's now validate that Ceph is health and has the additional storage. We again login to the toolbox.

----
kubectl -n rook-ceph exec -it $(kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod -l "app=rook-ceph-tools" -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') bash
----

And run Ceph commands to see the new OSDs.
